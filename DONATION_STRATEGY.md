- Platform must provide receipts
- Consult tax professional

**Regulations:**
- Less regulated than investments
- Still need clear terms
- Transparent fee disclosure

### Required Disclosures:
```
"Donations are gifts and do not entitle you to 
equity, returns, or repayment. Donations support 
project development but do not guarantee project 
success. Platform fee: 3% + optional tip. 
Tax-deductibility depends on project status."
```
